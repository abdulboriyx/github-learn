# Git and GitHub - SuperSimpleDev

This repository contains the files and code that I’ve learned from the <i>SuperSimpleDev</i> videos on Git and GitHub. The videos helped me build a solid foundation in using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.

## What I learnt

I have learn following concepts from SuperSimpleDev's videos:

- Git Installation: Installing and configuring Git on my local machine.
- Git Command Lines: 
  - `git init` – Initializing a new Git repository.
  - `git add` – Staging changes for commit.
  - `git commit` – Committing changes to the local repository.
  - `git push` – Pushing changes to a remote repository.
  - `git pull` – Pulling changes from a remote repository.
  - `git merge` – Merging branches to combine changes.
  - `git remote` – Managing remote repositories.
  - `git fetch` – Fetching changes from a remote without merging.
- Connecting Local and Online Git Repos: How to connect a local repository to an online GitHub repository and sync changes.
- Git Clone: Cloning a repository from GitHub to my local machine to work on it.
